Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/wiesehahn/baumarten/tree/1197f9ea752db273b485c853ea525f444c9a33f6" target="_blank">1197f9e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    data/sen2/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  data/reference/train_test/train_test.rds

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   code/workflow_project_setup.R

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Classification</h2>
<div id="model-tuning" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Tuning</h3>
<p>A number of model parameters can be changed to achieve different results. Model tuning changes these parameters to get optimal results. Overfitting might be a problem. Parameters to be changed in all classifiers are input variables (bands and indices in our case) and training data.</p>
<p>Hyperparameters in the random forest package include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ntree (Integer, default: 500): Number of trees to grow.</p></li>
<li><p>mtry (Integer, Defaults to the square root of the number of variables) The number of variables per split.</p></li>
<li><p>nodesize (Integer, default: 1): The minimum size of a terminal node.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="gridsearch-results" class="section level4">
<h4>Gridsearch Results</h4>
<p>The <em>number of trees</em> was held constant at a value of 500 because generally it is assumed that more trees give better performance. On the other side larger numbers also mean more processing time. Parameters for which a gridsearch was done are the <em>number of variables per split</em> and the <em>minimum terminal node size</em>.</p>

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final values used for the model were mtry = 8, splitrule = gini
 and min.node.size = 1.</code></pre>

<h4>Variable Importance</h4>
<p>As determined before, model parameters <em>minimal node size</em> and <em>variables per split</em> have limited influence on model performance. As a consequence it is likely that the choice of predictor variables is important for model performance.</p>
<p>Input variables considered as predictor variables in this study comprise:</p>
<p><em>Sentinel-2 bands and indices</em> - Bands: <em>B2</em>,<em>B3</em>,<em>B4</em>,<em>B5</em>,<em>B6</em>,<em>B7</em>,<em>B8</em>,<em>B8A</em>,<em>B11</em>,<em>B12</em> ??? - Indices: ???</p>
<p>In model fitting the relative variable importance is calculated to give an impression which predictor variables are valuable and which are less valuable for the prediction process. However, correlation between variables is not taken into account.</p>

<p>As we can see the importance metric varies between predictor variables, suggesting that the choice of predictor variables very much influences our model.

<h4>Model Simplification</h4>
<p>To simplify the model without loosing prediction accuracy we search for a model with less predictor variables, which has the same accuracy as the best performing model (max 2 % difference in accuracy).</p>
<p>As a result we get a model using the following 6 prediction variables instead of all 26 variables, which has almost the same accuracy.</p>
